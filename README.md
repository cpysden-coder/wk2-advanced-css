What to expect: <img width="1021" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-21 at 9 25 58 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65201372/134209637-2b31be68-df24-422f-b88b-aca023dd3860.png">

Things to improve upon:
- Putting working titles on the left hand side rather than on top of a section

- Really understanding the flexbox model
    - why would adding a margin stop the media query from working
    - how can I get a space between the work cards
    - getting flex to work in nav and footer consistently
